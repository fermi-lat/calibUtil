<!-- 
   Overall structure is some header information followed by
   a sequence of tile (or ribbon) data.  Tile (or ribbon) data is made up
   of data form the 2 PMTs that read the tile

   The header information comes in two parts:
     "generic" is relevant to any sort of calibration data,
               not just that from the ACD, such as the
               name of the instrument being calibrated.
               See further comments above the generic element
               declaration
     "dimension" contains all the parameters necessary to figure 
               out which data goes with which hardware entity.
               See further comments above the dimension element
               declaration

<!-- Container for all the header/metadata type information to be
     included here.  Complete metadata will be found in the calibration
     MySQL database. 

     Description of attributes:

            instrument    - one of "flight", "EM", etc.  Could also
                            be implemented as enumeration rather than
                            NMTOKEN
            timestamp     - when the file was written (date and time)
            calibType     - one of "ACD_Pedestal", "ACD_Gain",
                            etc.
            formatVersion - sufficient versioning information so that
                            software attempting to read the file can
                            determine if it supports this version. 
                            [Might get rid of this here and just keep
                            it in the MySQL metadata table]
