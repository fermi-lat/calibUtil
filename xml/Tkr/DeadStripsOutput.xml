        dtd for bad strips data file

    */

    Would be good to switch to schema so that common header elements
    could be included easily in schema for different calibration types.

<!-- Container for all the header/metadata type information to be
     included here.  Complete metadata will be found in the calibration
     MySQL database. 

     Description of attributes:

            instrument    - one of "flight", "EM", etc.  Could also
                            be implemented as enumeration rather than
                            NMTOKEN
            timestamp     - when the file was written (date and time)
            calType       - one of "TKRBadStrips", "CALLightAttenuation",
                            etc.
            formatVersion - sufficient versioning information so that
                            software attempting to read the file can
                            determine if it supports this version. 
                            [Might get rid of this here and just keep
                            it in the MySQL metadata table]

<!-- "tight", "loose" and "expected" are all expressed as percentage
     of events for which a strip is hit, and all are affected by the
     kind of event sample.

     "expected" is the percentage expected for a healthy channel.
     "tight" will be somewhat more than "expected" if we're looking
     for hot channels, less than "expected" if we're looking for
     dead.
     "loose" will be further from "expected" than "tight", but in the
