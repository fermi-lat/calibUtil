    Would be good to switch to schema so that common header elements
    could be included easily in schema for different calibration types.

     MySQL database. 

     Description of attributes:

            instrument    -- one of "flight", "EM", etc.  Could also
                             be implemented as enumeration rather than
                             NMTOKEN
            timestamp     -- when the file was written (date and time)
            calType       -- one of "TKRBadStrips", "CALLightAttenuation",
                             etc.
            formatVersion -- sufficient versioning information so that
                             software attempting to read the file can
                             determine if it supports this version. 
                             [Might get rid of this here and just keep
                             it in the MySQL metadata table]
