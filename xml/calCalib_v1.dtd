<!-- 
   Overall structure is some header information followed by
   a sequence of elements of the same type (such as calPed),
   each of which contains the information belonging to a single
   range of a single crystal (of a single face, where appropriate).

   The header information comes in two parts:
     "generic" is relevant to any sort of calibration data,
               not just that from the CAL, such as the
               name of the instrument being calibrated.
               See further comments above the generic element
               declaration
     "dimension" contains all the parameters necessary to figure 
               out which data goes with which hardware entity.
               See further comments above the dimension element
               declaration

     MySQL database. 

     Description of attributes:

            instrument    - one of "flight", "EM", etc.  Could also
                            be implemented as enumeration rather than
                            NMTOKEN
            timestamp     - when the file was written (date and time)
            calType       - one of "TKRBadStrips", "CALLightAttenuation",
                            etc.
            formatVersion - sufficient versioning information so that
                            software attempting to read the file can
                            determine if it supports this version. 
                            [Might get rid of this here and just keep
                            it in the MySQL metadata table]

<!-- Describe how the data is dimensioned:
        number of tower rows
        number of tower columns
        number of calorimeter layers
        number of crystals in a layer ("columns")
        number of faces      (mostly 2; 1 for light asymmetry data)
        number of ranges     (fixed at 4? for now just default to 4) 
   Use the following conventions to determine which data element 
   corresponds to a particular physical crystal, optional face and
   gain range:
       * Tower number is computed from row and column as
                 tower = column + (nCol)*row
       * The data can be viewed as a 5-dimensional array where
         the indices from most- to least-significant are
              tower
              layer
              xtal   (often called "column" in calorimeter code)
              face
              range
         So the first two data elements will correspond to 
           (tower=0,layer=0, xtal=0, face=0, range=0)
           (tower=0,layer=0, xtal=0, face=0, range=1)
 
         The total number of data elements is just
                nRow*nCol*nLayer*nXtal*nFace*nRange
