   include writing a new record, looking for the serial number of
   a "best match" record (findBest), and a method for retrieving 
   the information necessary to read the data set corresponding to
   a particular metadata record (getReadInfo). Writing a record 
   is done in stages:  open the record (openRecord), add certain 
   fields (addValidInterval, addNotes, etc.), and finally to write
   the full record to the database (insertRecord).

   The class contains definitions for several enumerated types, 
   corresponding to possible entries for columns in a metadata record.
   Within the MySQL database the values are kept as strings.  The
   enumerated types are provided to insulate clients from these 
   details; enumerations are easier to document and to check for validity.
